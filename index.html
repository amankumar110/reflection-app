    <p class="p1">The bending effect of light when it travels from one medium to another medium.</p>
    <p class="p1">when light travels from denser medium to rare medium(glass to Air) it bends away from normal.</p>

     <h2 class="h2">1.Incident ray</h2>
     <p class="p1">The Ray Which falls On the surface of another medium and refracted inside the medium</p>
     <h2 class="h2">2.Refracted Ray</h2>
     <p class="p1">when incident Ray falls on the surface of another it deviates it's path inside the medium and that deviated ray is called reflected ray.</p>
     <h2 class="h2" >Angle of incidence</h2>
     <p class="p1">the angle at which incident ray falls on the surface</p>
    <p class="p2">OR</p>
    <p class="p1">The angle between Normal and Incident day</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Angle of Reflection</h2>
    <p class="p1">The angle at which incident ray is reflected</p>
    <p class="p2">OR</p>
    <p class="p1">The angle between normal and reflected Ray</p>
    <h2 class="h2">Normal ray Or Normal</h2>
    <p class="p1">The perpendicular angle between angle of incidence and angle of Reflection</p>

    <h1 class="h1b">Laws of Refraction</h1>
    <h2 class="h2">1st Law Of Refraction</h2>
    <p class="p1">This law States that the incident ray,Refracted ray and Normal must lie on same plane.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">2nd Law Of Refraction</h2>
    <p class="p1">The Ratio Between Sine Angle Of incidence and Sine  angle Of Refraction Is Called Refractive index.It is diffrent for diffrent media and determines how much light will be refracted from the medium. </p>
    <p class="p1">It is represented by "n"</p>
    <p class="p1">n=Sin Angle of Incidence / Sin Angle of Reflection</p>
    <p class="p1">This is also called Snell's Law</p>
    <p class="p1">for instance,Diamond has highest refractive index between all other media so it is most sparkling substance and its refractive index is 2.42</p>
